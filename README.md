## Hi there, I’m Nessa 👋

I’m building a strong technical foundation focused on **Python, analytical problem-solving,
and data systems**, with the goal of pursuing a technical role in the IDF.

I’m especially interested in using code to **extract insight from complex or messy data** —
finding patterns, comparing scenarios, and building tools that help explain what’s really going on.

### Current focus
- Python-based analytical projects
- Algorithmic problem-solving and core data structures
- Turning raw data into clear, structured insights
- Writing clean, readable, and well-documented code

### Technical skills
- **Python** (primary focus)
- Java (foundational experience)
- JavaScript (basic experience)
- Data structures: arrays, hash maps, stacks, queues
- Git & GitHub

### What you’ll find here
Projects that reflect how I think: small but intentional tools that prioritize clarity,
insight, and reasoning.
