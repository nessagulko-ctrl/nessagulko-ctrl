## Hi there, I’m Nessa 👋

I’m building a strong technical foundation with a focus on **Python, problem-solving,
and data systems**, with the goal of pursuing a technical role in the IDF.

### Current focus
- Deepening Python proficiency through hands-on projects
- Strengthening algorithmic thinking and core data structures
- Writing clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Working with structured data (CSV / JSON)

### Technical skills
- **Python** (primary focus)
- Java (foundational experience)
- JavaScript (basic experience)
- Data structures: arrays, hash maps, stacks, queues
- Git & GitHub

### What you’ll find here
This GitHub documents my technical growth through small but intentional projects,
clear READMEs, and incremental improvements that reflect how I think and learn.
